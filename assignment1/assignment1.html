        Ever since I can remember, I have been a massive Boston Red Sox fan. I 
        grew up about 2.5 hours from the city, so any time my parents took me to
        a game, it was special. Since I have been in college, I have gone to 
        countless games at Fenway Park. The ballpark means a lot to me, 
        my family, and my friends because of the many fond memories we have all 
        made there.

        My favorite restaurant seems to change every week, but at the moment I 
        would say it is Picante. Follow this 
        <strong><a href="https://www.ilovepicante.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">link<a /></strong> 
        for their website.

        I don't think anyone would expect that I am pretty good at table tennis.
        I used to go to tournaments and I still go to clubs when I get the 
        chance.
